Insert the wanted airports code to an array variable "dac"

data.json consists of the information of almost each airport in world

the csv output file in this program is 132*132 (due to the 132 selected airports)

the NaN in the csv output file means 0kmh as other 0 (it means from PEK to PEK has no distance since it is the same location)

for example, C9 is the distance between DEL and HND in kmh
